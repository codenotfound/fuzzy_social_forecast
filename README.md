Master's thesis on the topic of drug use forecasting by means of fuzzy logic models.

This work focuses on three aspects: 

1. Analysis of drug policies and their relation to drug control activities and analytical tools used by governments to help form strategies to reduce drug use/harm from drug use.
2. Review of forecasting methods with special attention to new methods of "intellectual" data analysis". Among those methods based on fuzzy logic are specifically considered.
3. Development of a model and a proof-of-concept app that forecasts number of drug users in Saint-Petersburg based on key indicators that explain socio-economic situation in the city and also on drug situation-specific indicators. Done with extensive use of R language and its packages "frbs" and "Shiny".
